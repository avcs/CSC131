The only project I remember doing is probably programming a Minesweeper-like game in C++.
It was programmed using two arrays. One was for the revealed board where it shows blank spaces and where mines are located.
The other array was to print to the user their board. It would ask the user for the coordinates they would like to reveal and it would reveal either a mine or a number telling how many mines are in that 3x3 area. It prints the board by clearing the screen and then printing the board out line by line. The user would win if they revealed all empty spaces and lose when they reveal a mine.

Other programming assignments were just covering concepts such as stack, queues, arrays.
